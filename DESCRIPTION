Title: Analysis of Ecological Drivers on Ecosystem Multifunctionality
Description: Methods for the analysis of how ecological drivers affect the
    multifunctionality of an ecosystem based on methods of Byrnes et al. 
    2016 <https://doi.org/10.1111/2041-210X.12143> and Byrnes et al. 
    2022 <https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.03.17.484802>. Most standard
    methods in the literature are implemented (see vignettes) in a tidy
    format.
