\usage{
eff_num_func_no_d(adf_freq, q = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{adf_freq}{A data frame of functional "frequencies" - i.e. f_i/sum(f_i)}

\item{q}{Order of hill number used for index. Defaults to q=1, as in Shannon Diversity}
}
\value{
Returns a verctor of effective or standardized effective number of functions
}
\description{
eff_num_func_no_d
}
\details{
Takes a data frame, with functions standardized against total level of function
in their replicate as columns and replicates as rows. Returns the effective number of functions using the appropriate method. See Chao
et al. 2019 or Jost 2006 for details. Does not adjust for correlation between functions.
