\usage{
eff_num_func(dat, vars, q = 1, standardized = FALSE, D = NULL, tau = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{dat}{A data frame with functions in columns and rows as replicates as well as other information.}

\item{vars}{Column names of function variables}

\item{q}{Order of the diversity measure. Defaults to the
Shannon case where q = 1. For Simpson, q=2.}

\item{standardized}{Use standardized number of functions (scaled by total
number of functions, so between 0-1), or just raw effective number of
functions for calculation. Defaults to \code{FALSE}.}

\item{D}{A distance matrix describing dissimilarity between functions. Defaults
to NULL, and the index is calculated assuming all functions are different. If
it is not null, it must be a symmetric matrix with dimensions matching the
number of functions listed in \code{vars}.}

\item{tau}{A cutoff for degree of dissimilarity under which functions are considered
to be different. If tau is the minimum non-zero value of D, all functions are different.
if tau is the maximum value of D are greater, all functions are considered the same.}
}
\value{
Returns a vector of effective or standardized effective number of functions
}
\description{
Calculate the effective number of functions for rows in a dataset
}
\details{
Takes a data frame, variable names,  whether we want
an index standardized by number of functions or not, an order of Hill number for our
effective number of functions as well as a dissimilarity matrix (if desired) and value
for a dissimilarity cutoff (defaults to the average dissimilarity). It then calculates
and returns the effective number of functions using the appropriate method. See Chao
et al. 2019 for more.
