\usage{
eff_num_func_d(adf_freq, q = 1, D, tau = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{adf_freq}{A data frame of functional "frequencies" - i.e. f_i/sum(f_i)}

\item{q}{Order of hill number used for index. Defaults to q=1, as in Shannon Diversity}

\item{D}{A distance matrix describing dissimilarity between functions.}

\item{tau}{A cutoff for degree of dissimilarity under which functions are considered
to be different. If tau is the minimum non-zero value of D, all functions are different.
if tau is the maximum value of D are greater, all functions are considered the same.}
}
\value{
A vector of effective number of functions
}
